🚀 TrendSpotter: The Automated Insight Engine
=============================================

> **Tagline:** An event-driven data pipeline that converts raw CSV logs into executive-ready PDF reports with AI-generated narratives in under 30 seconds.

1\. The Problem (Real World Scenario)
-------------------------------------

**Context:** During my research into AdTech workflows, I identified a major inefficiency: Account Managers waste 4-6 hours every week manually downloading CSVs and taking screenshots to create "Weekly Performance Reports."

**The Pain Point:** This manual process is slow, boring, and error-prone. If a campaign is wasting budget, the client might not know for days because the reporting lag is too high.

> **My Solution:** I built **TrendSpotter**, an event-driven system. You simply drop a raw file into a folder, and 30 seconds later, you receive a fully analyzed, executive-ready PDF report in your email.

2\. Expected End Result
-----------------------

**For the User:**

*   **Input:** Drop a raw CSV file into the folder.
    
*   **Action:** Wait 30 seconds.
    
*   **Output:** Receive a professionally formatted PDF via email containing:
    
    *   Week-over-Week growth charts.
        
    *   A list of detected anomalies (e.g., "Traffic dropped 40% in Miami").
        
    *   An AI-written paragraph explaining _why_ the drop happened (correlated with Weather API).
        

3\. Technical Approach
----------------------

I wanted to challenge myself to build a system that is **Production-Ready**, moving beyond simple scripts to a robust **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline.

**System Architecture:**

1.  **Ingestion (Event-Driven):** A Python watchdog script listens for file changes in real-time.
    
2.  **Decision:** I chose **Polars over Pandas** because it handles larger datasets faster and enforces a stricter schema, which reduces bugs in production.
    
3.  **Anomaly Detection:** I implemented the **Isolation Forest** algorithm (Scikit-Learn) to mathematically identify "weird" data points (outliers) rather than just using hard-coded if/else rules.
    
4.  **Generative AI (The Analyst):**
    
    *   We pass the anomaly metadata to **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**.
        
    *   We use a **Few-Shot Prompt** technique to force the AI to sound like a Senior Data Analyst.
        
    *   _Guardrail:_ I implemented a validation step to ensure the AI's math matches the Polars dataframe to prevent hallucinations.
        
5.  **Reporting:** WeasyPrint renders the final HTML/CSS report into a pixel-perfect PDF.
    

4\. Tech Stack
--------------

*   **Language:** Python 3.11
    
*   **Data Engine:** Polars (Rust-based DataFrame library)
    
*   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest)
    
*   **AI Model:** Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (via Vertex AI)
    
*   **Orchestration:** Docker & Docker Compose
    
*   **Visualization:** Plotly & WeasyPrint
    

5\. Challenges & Learnings
--------------------------

_This project wasn't easy. Here are two major hurdles I overcame:_

**Challenge 1: AI Hallucinations**

*   **Issue:** Initially, the AI would invent reasons for data drops (e.g., claiming "It rained" when I provided no weather data).
    
*   **Solution:** I implemented a **"Strict Context" System Prompt**. I effectively told the AI: _"Only use the data provided in the JSON context. If you don't know, say 'Unknown'."_ This reduced hallucination rates significantly.
    

**Challenge 2: Docker Networking**

*   **Issue:** My Python container couldn't send emails out to the SMTP server.
    
*   **Solution:** I learned about Docker Networks and container isolation. I had to configure the SMTP ports and environment variables correctly in the docker-compose.yml to allow external traffic.
